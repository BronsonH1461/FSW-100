         <h3>The 2020 Team</h3> <!--block-->
        <div>
            <p> The Raiders so far have looked pretty good actually this year even though we are off to a 3-3 start. Derek Carr is probably having his best year that I've seen him play since 2016.
                Our team is pretty decent on both sides. With the help of Jonathan Abram who was drafted last year but didnt play due to injury, our defense has actually become one that you can respect. Along side Max Crosby who had the same amount of sacks as Nick Bosa last year.
                The defense can hold its own. Add the speedy Henry Ruggs to the offense with star second year runnning back Josh Jacobs , and breakout star TE Darren Waller. Both offense and defense can give any team a run for there money

        <h4>What About The Coach?</h4> <!--block-->
        <div>
            <span> You can't mention the Raiders history without mentioning Jon Gruden. For Good or for Bad. It's no secret that the Raiders and Jon Gruden have had a love hate relationship.</span>
            <span> With the first time him coaching the Raiders bringing great success, although short lived due to the fact that Owner at the time. AL Davis, gettting into an argumetn with Jon, led to the eventual trade to the Buccaneers where he would Win a Super Bowl that same year.</span> <!--inline-->
