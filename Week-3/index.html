        <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the<br>CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the<br>CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands<br>of pages of critical intelligence information with black<br>highlighters.</p>
        <p>According to the report, sections of the documents—<br>"almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are<br>marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines<br>impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting<br>policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

        <p>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the Cold War</li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
